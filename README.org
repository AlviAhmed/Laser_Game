*Status:* In Development 
*Type:* Personal Project 

* Description 
I am one of the lead developers for a laser puzzle game. My goals consist of developing the laser physics, interactions as well as developing the various laser beam "modifiers" that the game has to offer including componenets like prisms, combiners and beam splitters (all of which are explained in detail in the logs)


This game was made in the Godot engine along with GD script being used
to program it. As of now the game is currently under development 



* Fixing Persistent Beam Glitch 

Found the first glitch in game. While attempting to create a
reflection by having the mirror take the data of the input laser and
emit in its own beam in return, the data seems to persist in the
mirror object even when the input laser is no longer there

* Getting Mirrors and Reflections to Work Properly 

Fixed the glitch of persistent mirror beams by adding area collisions and enter / exit signals to those specific areas to signify when to stop emitting laser beam

* Getting level doors to work 


The goal is to create an object in which once the laser touches, a timer will start, once the timer ends the scene will reset

This will later be replaced with either a level change or win screen
UI

* Working with generating and seperating different colors 

Starting to experiment with different colored lasers as well combining and seperating them

I made generic splitter device to try to split beam paths and modulate the color of the laser beams at the same time, as seen in the image below it was a success

* Beam Splitter, Combiner and Prism  

Added 3 more laser modifying components as well colored doors. The colored doors will only accept corresponding laser color, only then the charging / timer will start.

The *beam splitter* is a laser modifier that splits the beam into 2 perpendicular laser beams of the same color. This is meant to give the user more path options. Can be used as substitute for a mirror if none are left.

The *prism* is like the beam splitter however, it if the input is a secondary color it splits the beams into its primary colors, if primary enters, acts like splitter. If the input laser is white, 3 lasers (red, blue, and yellow ) will be outputted

The *combiner* is able to combine either 2 primary colors to create its corresponding secondary color OR accept 1 secondary color and 1 primary color and create a white beam
